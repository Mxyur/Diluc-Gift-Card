            <h1 class="title">Diluc Elemental Burst</h1>
            <p class="desc">Diluc is a tall man of lean build with pale skin, red eyes and bright red hair, worn in a low ponytail that extends to his mid-back. His expression usually makes him appear bored, exasperated or unimpressed.
                Diluc wears a black dress shirt, a long white vest, and a black ascot with a red gem. Over this he dons a noir-colored coat that is adorned with golden trimmings and tassels, ending with black fur-trims. He wears black pants which are embellished with chains on his right thigh, while his Vision, attached to a belt, is settled upon his left thigh. Diluc also wears cuffed, dark brown boots held by multiple buckles, and a pair of black gloves which he has a habit of adjusting. Their palm sides are all red while the backs are black with a matching red diamond pattern. His outfit, Darknight Blaze, is described to be a smart and tasteful suit fit for a nobleman. </p>
